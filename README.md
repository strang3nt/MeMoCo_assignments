## Mthods and Models for Combinatorial Optimization (MeMoCo) assignments

This repository contains solutions for the 2 assignments of the MeMoCo
course from the Master's degree in Computer Science at Unipd.

The first assignment uses [IBM ILOG CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) C apis, to solve a set of TSP instances via linear programming.
The second assignment uses a heuristic to solve the same set of instances. 

Test cases are taken from the [stanford-algs](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs) github repository.
