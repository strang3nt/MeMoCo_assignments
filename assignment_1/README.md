# Models and Methods For Combinatorial Optimization (MeMoCo): 1st assignment

The goal of this assignment is to solve
the Traveling Salesman Problem via Mixed Integer Linear Programming, and
study up to which size the problem can be solved in different amounts of time (e.g. 0.1s, 1s, 10s,...).

The implementation uses CPLEX APIs.
